# Python Introduction Projects

## 0. Basic Arithmetic Exercise
**File:** `basic_operations.py`

Perform basic arithmetic operations with two predefined numbers.

**Variables:**
- `number1 = 10`
- `number2 = 5`

**Operations:**
- Addition
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication


## 1. Simple Interest Calculator
**File:** `simple_interest.py`

Calculate simple interest using the formula: `I = P * R * T`

**Variables:**
- `principal = 1000`
- `rate = 0.05`
- `time = 3`


## 2. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
**File:** `rectangle_area.py`

Calculate rectangle area using: `Area = length × width`

**Variables:**
- `length = 10`
- `width = 5`


## 3. Convert Hours to Seconds
**File:** `hours_to_seconds.py`

Convert hours to seconds (1 hour = 3600 seconds)

**Variable:**
- `hours = 2`


## 4. User Input Age Calculator
**File:** `future_age_calculator.py`

Calculate user's age in the year 2050 based on current age input.

**Flow:**
1. Prompt: "How old are you? "
2. Calculate: `current_age + 27`
3. Output result

**Example:**
How old are you? 30
In 2050, you will be 57 years old.


## 5. Personal Finance Calculator
**File:** `finance_calculator.py`

Calculate monthly savings and project annual savings with 5% interest.

**Inputs:**
- Monthly income
- Monthly expenses

**Calculations:**
- Monthly savings = income - expenses
- Projected annual savings = (monthly_savings × 12) + (monthly_savings × 12 × 0.05)

**Example:**
Enter your monthly income: 5000
Enter your total monthly expenses: 4000
Your monthly savings are $1000.
Projected savings after one year, with interest, is: $12600.
